# Statistics-and-Programming-Bootcamp
This repository contains materials for leading a statistics and programming bootcamp using R and Python. These materials were created for the Department of Psychology, Stanford University

## Overview
In this two-day bootcamp, you will learn some basic coding skills, and practice these coding skills as we review some introductory statistical methods. You’ll also learn some complementary skills to improve your computing workflow with Bash and Github. We’ll also cover some of the many facets of open science and talk through some good coding practices. By the end of this bootcamp, you’ll be well on your way to using these skills for your Psychology research!


## Learning Goals
There are three main goals that we hope you’ll achieve in this bootcamp:     
1. **Basic programming skills**    
	We will prioritize learning R, but will also provide some Python resources.
2. **Ability to use programming skills to implement introductory statistical methods**    
	Including t-tests, correlations, linear/logistic regression, and test-set validation
3. **Understanding of clear computing workflows**      
Including basic skills with Bash and Github, and knowledge of open science and good coding practices.
